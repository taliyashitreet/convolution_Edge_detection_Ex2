# convolution Edge detection
this exercise is about the concept of the convolution and edge
detection by performing simple manipulations on images.
This exercise covers: <br />
• Implementing convolution on 1D and 2D arrays <br />
You can read here : [Convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution "Wikipedia") <br />

• Performing image derivative and image blurring <br />
• Edge detection <br />
Identification edge by taking the 8 Neighbors for each pixel and find a zero crossing like :{+,0,-} / {+,-} <br />

• Hough Circles <br />
Identification circles on given image with Accumulator Matrix- you can read here : [Circle_Hough_Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_Hough_Transform "Wikipedia")

• Bilateral filter <br />
 smoothening a given image and reducing noise, while preserving edges
